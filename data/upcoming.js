    description:
      "Ubisoft is changing up the gameplay from a 3D action game to a 2.5D Metroidvania-esque adventure with a heavy emphasis on exploration and combat. Unlike the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, we got to know the release date from the get-go.This time, we play a new character, Sargon, as the titular Prince has been kidnapped. It’s up to Sargon and his Immortal companions to save the Prince, exploring a strange new land in this platform game and brawling with mythical beasts such as the Manticore. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the first big games in 2024, so here’s everything you need to know about the Prince of Persia The Lost Crown release date and any gameplay details we have from the trailers so far.",

      "While we got a brief taste of Tekken 8 during the Closed Network Test, this barely scratched the surface of what’s to come in the latest of Bandai Namco’s premier fighting game series. With Heihatchi Mishima seemingly dead after the events of Tekken 7, the story continues with Jin Kazama seeking to end the tyranny of his devil-wielding father, Kazuya Mishima. Many familiar faces are in the Tekken 8 roster, along with at least one brand-new fighter. New modes are also plentiful, including a unique take on the classic arcade mode. Most importantly, however, we have confirmation that the best minigame, Tekken Ball, is returning. But that begs the question: will that mode be online compatible? We can only hope.",

    description:
      "We’ve been wondering what Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady has been up to for years, and now we finally have our answer: a Suicide Squad game. We can’t say it’s the game we were hoping for, but Rocksteady has done a terrific job with the Batman license, so we’re quietly confident. We know that the game features the late, great Kevin Conroy as Batman, too, so that’s reason enough to look forward to the Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League release date.",

    description:
      "During a recent Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that Lara Croft and her pointy boobs would be returning to a PC or console near you. Yes, Tomb Raider I-III is getting remastered and rereleased in 2024, and the great thing is that you have the option to toggle between the new graphics and the old ones at will to see just how far the game has come. Even better is that the new graphics are truly just a remaster of the old, so it still has that classic Tomb Raider feel to it, unlike some more modern Tomb Raider content.",

      "Black Flag and For Honor meet for PvP sailing, piracy, and cannon-firing in Skull and Bones. With a familiar UI and control mechanism for anyone who’s played Assassin’s Creed’s sea-bound adventure, it’s no surprise that it’s garnered a following of fans since its announcement in 2017. Unfortunately, it’s been subject to continuous delays since then, but Ubisoft has now confirmed that the game is set to launch in February 2024.",
